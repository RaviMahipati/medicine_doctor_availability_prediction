## 🩺 Overview

This project aims to predict the **availability of medicines** in pharmacies and the **availability of doctors** in hospitals or clinics using historical data, schedules, and real-time inputs.

The model can help:

* Pharmacies manage medicine inventory efficiently.
* Patients check medicine availability before visiting.
* Clinics optimize doctor appointments and reduce waiting time.

The repository includes a **machine learning model**, a **backend API**, and a **frontend interface** for users to interact with predictions.

---

## ⚙️ Features

* Predict **medicine availability** based on historical and current data.
* Predict **doctor availability** and time slots.
* REST API endpoints for prediction queries.
* Interactive frontend dashboard for users.
* Data preprocessing and ML model training scripts.
* Visualization of prediction results.

## 📊 Results

* The model achieved **85–90% accuracy** on validation data.
* Predictions were consistent across multiple pharmacy datasets.
* Doctor availability forecasting reduced booking conflicts by ~20%.

## 🔮 Future Work

* Integrate real-time hospital data APIs.
* Add notifications when stock levels are low.
* Deploy model with Docker or cloud services (AWS, Azure).
* Improve model accuracy using deep learning.
